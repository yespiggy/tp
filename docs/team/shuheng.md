### Project: CapitalConnect

CapitalConnect is an application for helping venture capitalists manage their investment information. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. The application is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
