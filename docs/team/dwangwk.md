### Project: CapitalConnect

CapitalConnect is an application for helping venture capitalists manage their investment information. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. The application is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the `addnote`, `editnote`, `deletenote` commands, as well as their Parsers, relevant logic.
  * **What it does**: This allows users to add notes about their startups directly within the application.
  * **Justification**: These features enhance the user's ability to document important details about startups, crucial for making informed investment decisions. Managing notes efficiently helps in keeping track of key insights and updates related to various startups.

* **New Feature**: Added the Note Section User Interface
