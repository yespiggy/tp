### Project: CapitalConnect

CapitalConnect is an application for helping venture capitalists manage their investment information. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. The application is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the `find n/`, `find f/`, `find i/` commands.
  * **What it does**: This allows users to find corresponding startups from the Capital Connect data that have the matching names / funding stages / industries.
  * **Justification**: This is imperative for our users to locate the matching startups in CapitalConnect. These commands are essential for streamlining the process of locating relevant startups within the CapitalConnect platform. Venture capitalists can now efficiently identify promising investment opportunities based on their specific interests.

* **New Feature**: Added the `add-p` command.
  * **What it does**: This allows users to add key persons to the corresponding startup.
  * **Justification**: Considering that venture capitalists might also want to store key employees' information like their names, emails, positions in the startup, or educations, we include these fields into this command so that they can easily check the related employees' information. This feature empowers venture capitalists to maintain comprehensive information about the key employees within the startups they are considering for investment. This enables a more informed decision-making process.
