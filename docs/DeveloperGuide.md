## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StartupListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Startup` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a startup).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Startup` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStartupList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Startup` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Startup>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Startup` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Startup` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find Commands
The find commands allows users to find the startups with matching names, funding stages, or industries.
There are three find commands in CapitalConnect: `find n/`, `find i/`, `find f`. The implementation of these three commands are similar. Here we use the `find n/` command to illustrate how they are executed.

#### Find by Name
The `find n/` function allows users to find the startups that contain the names that users are interested in.

This function will display startup cards that have the same name as users provide. The startup card contains information other than the startup names, such as addresses, emails, phone numbers, etc..

To find the wanted startup, a `NamesContainsKeywordsPredicate` is created to test whether a startup has a name that matches the user's input keywords. Similarly, `find f/` and `find i/` will create `FundingStageContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `InudstryContainsKeywordsPredicate` respectively. These commands only change the displayed list of startups, stored as `filteredStartups` in `Model`, without affecting the data stored in CapitalConnect.

A typical program flow is as follows:

1. User enters a command to find startups by names, e.g. `find n/Apple`.
2. The input is passed to the `AddressbookParser` class which calls `FindCommandParser`. `FindCommandParser` attempts to parse the flags present, and in this case is `n/`. Note that `FindCommandParser` does not check invalid inputs like partial keywords. `FindCommandParser` will only throw an exception if the keyword is empty.
3. If the parse is successful, a `NamesContainsKeywordsPredicate` is created to find the startups that contain the name `Apple`.
4. A new `FindCommand` is created from the predicate and passed back to `LogicManager`.
5. The command is executed. The `filteredStartups` is updated with the predicate passed into the command.
6. The command result is created and passed back to the `LogicManager`

The following sequence diagram illustrates the execution process of a find by name command.

<puml src="diagrams/FindByName.puml" alt="FindByName" />

### AddNote, EditNote, and DeleteNote Commands

The `addnote`, `editnote`, and `deletenote` commands enhance the ability of users to manage detailed annotations for each startup in CapitalConnect. These commands allow users to append notes, modify existing ones, or remove them from startups respectively. This section will delve into the implementations of these commands.

#### AddNote Command

The `addnote` command allows users to add a note to a specific startup.

**Program Flow:**
1. **Input Parsing**: The user enters a command like `addnote 1 This is a new note.` The input is processed by `AddNoteCommandParser` which parses the startup index and the note content.
2. **Command Execution**: A new `Note` object is created, and `AddNoteCommand` is instantiated with the parsed index and `Note`. When executed, the command retrieves the specified startup by index from `Model`, adds the new note to the startup's notes list, and updates the model.
3. **Result Generation**: A success message is generated, indicating that the note has been successfully added.

**Sequence Diagram for AddNote Command**:

<puml src="diagrams/AddNoteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddNote" />

#### EditNote Command

The `editnote` command enables the modification of an existing note within a startup's note list.

**Program Flow:**
1. **Input Parsing**: Users input a command like `editnote 1 2 Updated content of the note.` where `1` is the startup index and `2` is the note index within that startup. `EditNoteCommandParser` parses these indices and the new note content.
2. **Command Execution**: The command looks up the startup by the first index and the note by the second index, then replaces the old note content with the new one.
3. **Result Generation**: A success message is displayed to indicate the note was edited.

**Sequence Diagram for EditNote Command**:

<puml src="diagrams/EditNoteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EditNote" />

#### DeleteNote Command

The `deletenote` command allows users to remove a note from a startup.

**Program Flow:**
1. **Input Parsing**: The user enters a command like `deletenote 1 1`, aiming to delete the first note of the first startup. `DeleteNoteCommandParser` parses the indices.
2. **Command Execution**: The command verifies both indices, retrieves the corresponding startup and note, and removes the note from the startup's note list.
3. **Result Generation**: A confirmation message is returned, indicating successful deletion.

**Sequence Diagram for DeleteNote Command**:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteNoteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteNote" />

### Common Features Across Note Commands

- **Validation**: Each command ensures that the indices provided are within the valid range before proceeding with modifications. If not, an error message is shown.
- **Model Update**: All commands interact with the `Model` to either add, modify, or delete notes, ensuring that all changes are reflected.

These commands collectively provide robust functionality for managing detailed annotations on startups, facilitating better information management within CapitalConnect.

### Add and Edit Person Commands

### Add Person Command
The add person command allows users to add key employees' information into a startup.

The key employee information will be displayed in the people pane, next to the startup card view. Through this function, users can keep track of employees' name, email, and other related information.

A typical program flow is as follows:
1. User enters a command to add a key employee to the first startup, e.g. `add-p 1 pn/John pe/johndoe@example.com pd/founder`.
2. The input is passed to the `AddressbookParser` class which calls `AddPersonCommandParser`, and then the `AddPersonCommandParser` parses the keywords from the user's input.
3. The `AddPersonCommandParser` checks whether all required fields are entered and whether the index is valid. If all checks are passed, the program will move onto `AddPersonCommand`.
4. If the key employee does not exist in the startup, the startup's employee information will then be updated to include the new person.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of execution of an add person command.

<puml src="diagrams/AddPerson.puml" alt="AddPerson" />

### Edit Person Command
The edit person command allows users to edit key employees' information into a startup.

The key employee information will be displayed in the people pane, next to the startup card view. Through this function, users can keep track of employees' name, email, and other related information.

A typical program flow is as follows:
1. User enters a command to edit a key employee of the first startup, e.g. `edit-p 1 1 pn/John pe/johndoe@example.com pd/founder`.
2. The input is passed to the `AddressbookParser` class which calls `EditPersonCommandParser`, and then the `EditPersonCommandParser` parses the keywords from the user's input.
3. The `EditPersonCommandParser` checks whether all required fields are entered and whether the both indexes are valid. If all checks are passed, the program will move onto `EditPersonCommand`.
4. If the EditPersonCommand doesn't cause duplicate key employee to exist in the startup (a duplicate key employee is noted by having the same email as an existing key employee) the startup's employee information will then be updated.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of execution of an add person command.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancement**

Team size: 4

1. Limit length of startup name: Currently we do not limit length of startup name user can input. This
results in overflow. We plan to address this in the future by limiting length of startup names to 32 letters long.

2. Supporting country codes: Currently we do not allow users to specify country codes using "-", this makes it hard to track
international numbers. We plan to allow for the user to add an optional country code field alongside the phone number in further iterations.

3. Limit phone numbers: Currently we do not limit the length of phone numbers users can input. This may result in a UI overflow.
We plan to address this in the future by limiting the length of the phone number to 8 digits for the number and 3 digits for the country code after planned enhancement 2 has been completed.

4. Supporting non-alphanumerical characters in startup names: Some company names may contain non-alphanumerical characters. We plan to address this in the future by allowing for such characters to be in the name,
but also changing the current regular expression rules to ensure that the input remains valid.

5. Supporting non-alphanumerical characters in tags: Currently tags must be in alphanumerical characters without spacings. This forces users to find alternative means to add tags, such as using camel case within their tags instead. For example,
`US based` would not be an allowed tag, resorting in users tagging the startup as `USBased` instead. We plan to address this in the future by allowing for such characters to be in the tag,
but also changing the current regular expression rules to ensure that the input remains valid.

6. Limited types of funding stage: Currently, we only support traditional funding stages, so inputs for `FUNDING_STAGE` should be either `S`, `PS`, `A`, `B` or `C` in order to find a matching startup. `A`, `B`, `C` represents the respective funding series whilst `PS` refers to pre-seed and `S` refers to the seed stage. Please take note that inputs other than the ones mentioned above will also be accepted, but zero matching startups will be listed.

7. Supporting partial matching in find commands: We understand that you might want to use partial matching to find matching startups, but this feature is currently under development. This feature will be dropped soon!

8. Potential limitation in detecting duplicated persons: Note that duplicated persons in one startup are detected by `pe/EMAIL`. We assume that email is unique for every person. In other words, we assume that it is possible to have 3 Johns in one company, and they all have different emails. Before adding a new person to the startup, always double-check their email to make sure that the person is not added already. Also take note that we allow one person to work in multiple startups.
