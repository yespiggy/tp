1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/Pichu p/98765432 i/finance v/10 f/B e/pichuhr@example.com a/pichu street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a start up called `Pichu` to CapitalConnect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/capital connect`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/capital connect t/stealth startup` or as `n/capital connect`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/stealth startup`, `t/steath startup t/mvp` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** We only support traditional funding stages, hence inputs for `FUNDING_STAGE` must be either `S`, `PS`, `A`, `B` or `C`!
`A`, `B`, `C` represents the respective funding series whilst `PS` refers to pre-seed and `S` refers to the seed stage.
</box>

**Tip:** You can't give us blank inputs! We need you to give us a valid input for mandatory fields! Check that phone number again,
did you accidentally add a digit?
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** We understand that profitable investments requires prospecting a large range of industries. Hence, we have no restrictions on `INDUSTRY`!
We let **you** decide how specific you want to define your startup categories by! If `Tech` is too general, you can now use more specific industry categories, such as
`web 3`, `AI`, `IAAS`!
</box>

* `add n/Google p/98765432 e/sundarpichal@example.com v/100000 a/Menlo Park, block 123, #01-01 f/A i/tech`

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
